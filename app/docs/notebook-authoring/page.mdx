# Notebook Authoring

NodeBooks blends Markdown, runnable TypeScript, and reusable UI components so you can tell a complete story inside a single notebook. The authoring surface encourages experimentation without sacrificing polish.

<SectionHeading id="markdown-and-code">Markdown and code live together</SectionHeading>

Draft ideas in Markdown cells, then drop into TypeScript when you need dynamic behavior. AI-assisted suggestions accelerate repetitive coding tasks so you can focus on the narrative.

<SectionHeading id="rich-components">Rich components and visualizations</SectionHeading>

Use built-in charting, diagramming, and UI components to make findings stand out. Render interactive elements inline, prototype dashboards, or embed bespoke React components sourced from your design system.
