# NodeBooks Documentation

NodeBooks combines a friendly notebook surface with the power of Node.js so you can explore ideas, collaborate, and publish in a single tool. These docs outline the product pillars today and leave room for deeper guides as the platform evolves.

<SectionHeading id="how-to-use">How to use these docs</SectionHeading>

Use the sidebar to jump between key workflows. Each guide explains the why behind the feature set, highlights the current capabilities, and calls out the next pieces to document as the platform grows.

- [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) walks through installing the CLI and initializing a workspace.
- [Notebook Authoring](/docs/notebook-authoring) focuses on writing Markdown, TypeScript, and visual outputs together.
- [Runtime & Dependencies](/docs/runtime-and-dependencies) covers the sandboxed execution model and dependency management.
- [Collaboration](/docs/collaboration) shows how real-time presence keeps teams in sync.
- [Publishing & Sharing](/docs/publishing) explains how to ship notebooks as public-facing sites.

<SectionHeading id="whats-next">What comes next</SectionHeading>

Future iterations of the documentation will dive into workspace governance, deployment pipelines, and custom component authoring. As new features ship, expand each section with tutorials, API references, and troubleshooting guides.
