# Runtime & Dependencies

Every notebook executes inside an isolated Node.js sandbox tuned for TypeScript. This keeps experiments reproducible while still letting you install the packages and tools you rely on.

<SectionHeading id="node-runtime">Sandboxed Node.js runtime</SectionHeading>

Each notebook runs on demand with scoped environment variables, ensuring secrets never leak between projects. Streaming output keeps you informed about long-running tasks without leaving the page.

<SectionHeading id="dependencies">Manage dependencies per notebook</SectionHeading>

Install npm packages directly from a notebook cell or pin them in `package.json` for the entire workspace. NodeBooks keeps dependency state isolated so collaborators can explore without affecting production projects.
