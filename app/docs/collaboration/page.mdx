# Collaboration

NodeBooks keeps everyone in the loop while experiments unfold. Real-time presence indicators, shared output streams, and session sharing remove the friction of pairing on notebooks remotely.

<SectionHeading id="presence">Presence-aware editing</SectionHeading>

Know who is editing a notebook and where their cursor is in real time. Inline comments and suggestions make asynchronous reviews feel collaborative.

<SectionHeading id="shared-output">Shared execution output</SectionHeading>

Notebook runs stream output to every participant, so you never wonder if a cell finished or failed. Broadcast a session during reviews or pair programming without screen sharing.
