# Publishing & Sharing

Turn exploratory notebooks into polished deliverables without leaving the platform. NodeBooks handles build orchestration so you can focus on storytelling and distribution.

<SectionHeading id="ship-sites">Ship notebook sites</SectionHeading>

Publish notebooks directly to the web with a few clicks. Preview deployments in private spaces, collect feedback, and push live when the content is ready.

<SectionHeading id="iterate">Iterate with your team</SectionHeading>

Keep iterating on notebooks after they launch. Versioned deployments and workspace access controls let you refine docs, demos, and educational material safely.
